            I will be posting photos that I take with my Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra as I attempt to learn more on Digital Photography, there will be unedited photos as well as edited photos that were edited with <a href = "https://www.gimp.org/">Gimp</a> via my PC or <a href = "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.niksoftware.snapseed&hl=en_US">Snapseed</a> on my S24 Ultra for comparison.
